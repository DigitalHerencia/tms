## 🤖 GitHub Automation Agents for FleetFusion

### Convention Enforcement Agent

-   **Purpose:** Enforces branch naming and PR title conventions automatically.
-   **How It Works:** Runs on every PR (including forks) using `pull_request_target` event.
-   **Features:**
    -   Validates branch names against approved prefixes
    -   Validates PR titles using semantic format
    -   Provides actionable feedback via PR comments
    -   Auto-labels PRs based on branch type
    -   Prevents merge of non-compliant PRs
    -   Updates comments instead of creating duplicates
-   **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/conventions.yml`

### PR Automation Agent

-   **Purpose:** Automates PR labeling, issue linking, and review assignments.
-   **Features:**
    -   Auto-assigns reviewers
    -   Links PRs to referenced issues
    -   Assigns priority based on PR type
    -   Tracks dependencies between issues/PRs
-   **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml`

---

## 2️⃣ Branching & Commit Rules

-   **NEVER commit directly to `main`.**
-   **All work must occur in a branch** named with these prefixes:
    -   `feature/<scope>` ― new features
    -   `fix/<scope>` ― bugfixes
    -   `docs/<scope>` ― docs/README
    -   `test/<scope>` ― tests
    -   `refactor/<scope>` ― code quality
    -   `config/<scope>` ― config/env setup
-   **All PRs:** Title must be `[type]: description` (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `config:`).
-   **PR Descriptions:** Must include:
    -   Linked issues using closing keywords (e.g., `Closes #42`)
    -   Short summary of scope and impact
    -   Checklist: [ ] Passes CI, [ ] Updates docs (if needed), [ ] Notifies project board/milestone
-   **Labels:** PRs auto-labeled by branch prefix and must include one of: `Feature`, `Bug`, `Documentation`, `Testing`, `Code-Quality`, `Configuration`.
-   **Milestones:** All PRs must be assigned to an active milestone if related to a release.

---

## 3️⃣ Issue Management & Templates

-   **Labels:** Every issue must be labeled with:
    -   Type (`Feature`, `Bug`, `Documentation`, `Testing`, `Code-Quality`, `Configuration`)
    -   Priority (`Priority-High`, `Priority-Medium`, `Priority-Low`)
    -   Assignment (`Codex`, `Copilot`)
    -   Workflow (`Has-PR`, `Blocked`, `Technical-Debt`)
-   **Templates:** Use or extend `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for:
    -   Bug report
    -   Feature request
    -   Docs/Chore
-   **Dependencies:** Link related issues/PRs via GitHub keywords (`blocked by #X`, `closes #Y`).
-   **Project Board:** All issues must be moved to the correct board column (`Todo`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`) as soon as status changes.  
    **Reminder:** Update the project board and milestone on every status change.

---

## 4️⃣ Pull Request Automation

-   **Auto-label PRs** based on branch prefix.
-   **Auto-assign reviewers** (for solo dev, self-assignment is valid).
-   **All PRs run CI:** Must pass `ci/test`, `ci/lint`, `ci/typecheck` before merge.
-   **Auto-move** PRs/issues on the project board per status (see board flow below).
-   **Merge Rule:** Only squash merge allowed, never rebase or merge commits.
-   **No direct pushes to main.**
-   **PR merges:** Only after human (your) review and CI passes.

---

## 5️⃣ Project Board & Milestone Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph "Project Board"
    A[📋 Todo] -->|Start Work| B[🔄 In Progress]
    B -->|Create PR| C[👀 Review]
    C -->|Merge| D[✅ Done]
  end
  subgraph "Auto-Movement"
    E[New Issue] --> A
    F[Add Feature/Bug Label] --> B
    G[Has-PR Label] --> C
    H[Close Issue/PR] --> D
  end
```

-   **Milestone closure:** Only after all assigned issues/PRs are closed and released.

---

## 6️⃣ Release & Deployment

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[feature/* branch] -->|PR created| B[GitHub Actions CI]
  B -->|Tests pass| C[Vercel Preview Deploy]
  C -->|Review approved| D[Squash merge to main]
  D -->|Auto-deploy| E[Production: fleet-fusion.vercel.app]
  F[main branch] -->|Tag release| G[Production Release]
  G --> H[Close milestone]
```

-   **Production deploys:** Only from tagged commits on `main`.
-   **CI/CD:** Automated via GitHub Actions → Vercel.
-   **Secrets:** All environment secrets must be managed via repository/environment settings (NEVER in code).

---

## 7️⃣ Automation & Workflow Suggestions

-   **Issue templates:** Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` for feature, bug, docs.
-   **PR template:** Create `.github/pull_request_template.md` enforcing:
    -   `[type]: description` title
    -   Linked issues
    -   Checklist (CI, docs, board, milestone)
-   **Auto-label action:** Use `actions/labeler` to tag PRs by branch prefix.
-   **Project automation:** Use GitHub Projects (beta/next) for auto-move on status update.
-   **Branch protection:** Enable required status checks, require PR review, disable force-pushes.
-   **Dependency tracking:** Always refer to issue/PR numbers in descriptions with closing/blocked keywords.
-   **Reminder:** Update project board and milestones with every PR/issue update.

---

## 8️⃣ Secrets & Security

-   **Required:** `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `NEON_API_KEY`
-   **Never commit secrets.** Use GitHub Actions secrets and Vercel dashboard for env vars.

---

## 9️⃣ Summary — Non-Negotiables

1. **No direct commits to main.**
2. **All work on prefixed branches, PRs must follow `[type]: description`.**
3. **Labels, project, milestone, and automation must be maintained for every PR/issue.**
4. **PRs: squash merge only, after passing CI and review.**
5. **Update board and milestones with every status change.**
6. **All releases and deployments strictly follow CI flow.**

---

**Strictly follow these standards for all automation, PRs, issues, and releases. Deviations break project automation and release integrity.**
